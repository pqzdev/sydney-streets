# Australian Capital Cities Street Names

Interactive visualization of street names and patterns across Australia's capital cities, featuring advanced street counting algorithms.

**[Live Demo](https://australian-streets.pages.dev/)** | **[Research Methodology](./METHODOLOGY.md)**

## Overview

This project visualizes street data across **Australia's capital cities** to explore interesting patterns in street naming:
- Most popular street names (counted using Grid 200m algorithm)
- Streets named after suburbs
- Tree-themed street names
- Royalty-themed street names
- Geographic clustering of name patterns
- Compare naming patterns across different cities

### Currently Available Cities

- **Sydney** - Greater Sydney (33 LGAs, NSW Government definition)
- **Melbourne** - Greater Melbourne (31 LGAs, Victorian Government definition) 🚧 _Coming soon_
- Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Darwin, Canberra - _Planned_

**Geographic Scope**: Each city uses official government definitions of "Greater [City]" boundaries. See [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) for the complete list of LGAs and sources.

## Street Counting Methodology

A key challenge in this project is **counting unique instances of streets**. When "Victoria Street" appears in OpenStreetMap data, how do we know if it's one street or multiple distinct streets that share a name?

We researched and compared **5 different algorithms** to solve this problem:

1. **Point-to-Point Distance**: Check if any points on segments are within threshold distance
2. **Grid-based Flood Fill**: Divide map into grid cells and flood fill connected regions ⭐ **Winner**
3. **Polygon Buffer Intersection**: Create buffer polygons and check for intersections
4. **Endpoint-Only Distance**: Only check distances between segment endpoints
5. **Highway-Aware**: Hybrid method for handling long highways with gaps

### Winner: Grid 200m + Flood Fill

After extensive testing on 23 streets across Sydney:

- **224x faster** than Point-to-Point method (0.028s vs 6.28s)
- **Equivalent accuracy** to geometric methods
- **Scalable** to large datasets
- **Simple** implementation with no external dependencies

## Data Sources

### NSW Government Data (Primary)
- **Source**: [Data.NSW Road Segment Data](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/2-road-segment-data-from-datansw)
- **Format**: GeoJSON with street polylines and metadata
- **Coverage**: Complete NSW road network
- **Attributes**: Road names, types, suburbs, geometries

### OpenStreetMap (Alternative)
- **Source**: [Overpass API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)
- **Format**: GeoJSON
- **Query**: Streets within Sydney bounding box
- **Note**: Used for methodology research

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pqzdev/sydney-streets.git
cd sydney-streets
```

2. Start a local server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
open http://localhost:8000
```

3. The visualization will load with sample OSM data

### Running Method Comparisons

To reproduce our research findings:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install shapely scipy numpy

# Run comparison on test streets
python3 scripts/compare_methods.py

# Generate summary tables
python3 scripts/generate_summary_table.py

# View results
open compare_visualization.html
open summary.html
```

## Key Findings

From our methodology research:

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Grid 200m | ⚡⚡⚡ (224x) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Production use |
| Grid 100m | ⚡⚡⚡ (170x) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Dense urban areas |
| Polygon Buffer 100m | ⚡⚡ (2.8x) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Geometric accuracy |
| Point-to-Point 100m | ⚡ (1x) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Baseline/validation |
| Highway-Aware | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Long highways |

**Perfect highway counting**: Our Highway-Aware method correctly identifies Pacific Highway (722 segments) as 1 instance, while all other methods incorrectly counted it as 5 instances.
